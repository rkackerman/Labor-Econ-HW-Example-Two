Labor-Econ-HW-Example-Two
=========================

This repository contains a set of files related to a second assignment I completed in a graduate level Labor Econ course.  The assignment, and supporting data files were supplied by the course Professor.  I have edited them to remove any course information that might lead future students to identify the assignments.  The following files are included:

1. Homework 3.docx is the original assignment
2. Grad-Labor-HW3.pdf is my written submission
3. Grad-Lavor-HW3. is the LaTeX file that generated 2.
4. nsw.dta is the data provided by the course Professor
5. HW3_Ackerman.do is the STATA. do file the executes the required analysis
6. HW3_Ackerman.log is the STATA .log file that details the successful exedution of 5.


Note: All files have been edited to remove course identifying information.
